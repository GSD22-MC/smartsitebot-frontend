## 1. Current Topical Coverage Snapshot

**Status:** Pre-launch site - no existing content to analyze.

**Opportunity:** Clean slate to build authoritative topical coverage from day one without competing against existing thin content or fixing structural issues.

**Key Competitive Intel:**
- **WEBPRO Trade:** Targets "builders plumbers electricians" but expensive custom approach
- **DotGO:** 17+ years experience, strong on "construction web design" but traditional pricing model
- **Checkatrade/MyBuilder:** Massive authority but focused on trade directories, not website creation
- **Gap Identified:** No major player offers "free websites + £10 hosting" specifically for UK/Ireland trades
