## What Drives High Agency Costs?

Understanding agency cost structure helps explain pricing:

**Agency Overhead Costs:**
- Office rent and utilities: £2,000-£8,000 monthly
- Staff salaries and benefits: £15,000-£50,000 monthly
- Sales and marketing expenses: £3,000-£10,000 monthly

- Project management overhead: 15-25% of project cost

**Profit Margins:**
- Target profit margins: 40-60% of project cost

These legitimate business costs explain why agencies must charge high prices, but they don't necessarily benefit trade businesses requiring straightforward websites.

## Return on Investment Calculation

Website costs should be evaluated against lead generation and business growth:

**Traditional Agency ROI:**
- Average agency website cost: £6,000 (3 years)
- Required monthly leads to break even: 12-15 (at £35 average lead value)
- Pressure to generate immediate returns
- High risk if website underperforms

**SmartSiteBot ROI:**
- Total 3-year cost: £360
- Required monthly leads to break even: 1 (at £35 average lead value)
- Low risk, high reward potential
- Immediate positive ROI with minimal lead generation

**Real Example:**
Sarah's Electrical (Birmingham) previously paid £4,500 for an agency website that generated 2-3 leads monthly. After switching to SmartSiteBot, she generates 5-6 leads monthly while paying £10/month instead of £200/month maintenance.

## Making the Right Investment Decision

Consider these factors when evaluating website costs:

**Budget Reality Check:**
- Can you afford £5,000+ upfront without affecting cash flow?
- Are ongoing £200-£500 monthly costs sustainable?
- What happens if the website doesn't generate expected leads?

**Business Size Appropriateness:**
- Solo traders: Focus on lead generation, not premium design
- Small teams: Prioritise functionality over complex features
- Established businesses: Consider custom solutions if budget allows

**Time to Value:**
- Agencies: 6-12 weeks from start to launch
- DIY builders: 4-8 weeks learning and building
- SmartSiteBot: 24-48 hours from enquiry to live website

**Risk Assessment:**
- High-cost solutions create pressure for immediate ROI
- Low-cost solutions allow experimentation and growth
- No-contract solutions provide flexibility for changing needs

## FAQs

**Why do web agencies charge so much for trade websites?**
High overhead costs, complex processes, and custom development requirements drive agency pricing. They're not necessarily overcharging, but their business model doesn't suit most trade businesses.

**What's the real difference between a £3,000 and £300 trade website?**
Minimal difference in lead generation and customer perception. The expensive version might have more design customisation, but trade customers prioritise functionality over aesthetics.

**Are there hidden costs with the £10/month model?**
No. The £10/month covers hosting, security, backups, and basic support. Domain registration and email are included. No premium features to unlock later.

**What if I need changes to my website after launch?**
Basic content updates are free through your dashboard. We'll help with any changes during your first month at no charge.

**How do I know if expensive web design is worth it?**
If you're generating £50,000+ annually and want extensive customisation, premium agencies might be worth considering. For most trades, professional templates provide better ROI.
