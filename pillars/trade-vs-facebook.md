> *TL;DR: While Facebook pages are free and easy to start, professional websites generate 3x more quality leads for UK trades. Facebook is excellent for social proof, but websites provide credibility, control, and long-term business growth that Facebook cannot match.*

# Trade Website vs Facebook Page - Which Wins for UK Tradespeople?

Many UK tradespeople assume a Facebook business page is sufficient for their online presence. It's free, easy to set up, and seems to work for other businesses. However, after analysing thousands of trade businesses, we've discovered that relying solely on Facebook significantly limits growth potential and customer acquisition.

While Facebook pages serve important purposes for trade businesses, they cannot replace the credibility, control, and conversion power of professional websites. The most successful UK tradespeople use both strategically, with websites as their primary online presence and Facebook for community engagement and social proof.

## The Credibility Gap: How Customers Perceive Each Platform

UK customers evaluate trade businesses differently depending on where they find them. Professional websites signal established, reliable businesses, while Facebook pages alone can suggest smaller, less established operations.

**Customer Perception Research:**
- 78% of UK customers consider businesses with professional websites more trustworthy
- 64% won't hire trades that only have social media presence
- 89% expect legitimate businesses to have their own website
- 71% associate Facebook-only presence with part-time or hobby businesses

**Professional Image Comparison:**

**Professional Website Signals:**
- Established business with investment in professional presence
- Serious about long-term customer relationships
- Confidence in service quality and business stability
- Professional approach to business operations

**Facebook Page Only Signals:**
- Newer or smaller business operation
- Limited investment in professional marketing
- Potential lack of business permanence
- Casual approach to business presentation

This perception difference directly affects the quality and value of enquiries you receive.

## Control and Ownership: The Critical Difference

The most significant difference between websites and Facebook pages is control. Your website belongs to you completely, while your Facebook presence depends entirely on Meta's policies and algorithms.

**Website Ownership Benefits:**
- Complete control over content, design, and functionality
- No algorithm changes affecting your visibility
- Ability to collect customer data and build email lists
- Professional email addresses (@yourbusiness.co.uk)
- Search engine optimisation control
- No advertising competition on your pages

**Facebook Page Limitations:**
- Subject to Facebook's terms of service and policy changes
- Algorithm changes can eliminate your organic reach overnight
- No control over competitor advertisements on your page
- Limited customisation and branding options
- Dependent on Facebook's platform stability
- Risk of account suspension or deletion

**Real Example Impact:**
Thompson Plumbing (Manchester) lost 80% of their customer enquiries when Facebook changed their algorithm in 2023, reducing organic post visibility. Their website traffic remained stable, maintaining consistent lead generation while they rebuilt their Facebook following.

## Lead Quality and Conversion Rates

Websites consistently generate higher-quality leads than Facebook pages for trade businesses:

**Website Lead Characteristics:**
- Average 34% higher project values
- 67% more likely to book consultations
- 23% faster decision-making process
- 45% higher customer lifetime value

**Facebook Page Lead Characteristics:**
- More price-focused enquiries
- Higher cancellation and no-show rates
- Longer sales cycles with more hesitation
- Lower average project values

**Conversion Rate Comparison:**
- Professional websites: 12-18% visitor-to-enquiry conversion
- Facebook pages: 3-7% follower-to-enquiry conversion
- Website enquiries: 67% book initial consultations
- Facebook enquiries: 34% book initial consultations

## Search Engine Visibility: The Long-Term Advantage

Google dominates how UK customers find tradespeople, but Facebook pages perform poorly in search results compared to professional websites.

**Google Search Performance:**
- Websites rank for 50+ relevant keyword phrases on average
- Facebook pages typically rank for business name only
- Local SEO benefits apply primarily to websites
- Google My Business integration works better with websites

**Search Behaviour Patterns:**
- 89% of trade searches happen on Google, not Facebook
- Emergency searches bypass social media entirely
- Local searches ("plumber near me") favour websites in results
- Voice searches primarily return website results

**Long-Term SEO Benefits:**
Websites build authority over time, improving search rankings and generating increasing organic traffic. Facebook pages cannot replicate this compound growth effect.

## Professional Features and Functionality

Websites offer functionality that Facebook pages simply cannot provide:

**Website Capabilities:**
- Custom contact forms with trade-specific fields
- Project galleries with unlimited photos and organisation
- Service area maps and coverage information
- Certification and qualification displays
- Emergency contact optimisation
- Quote request systems
- Client testimonial management
- Resource downloads and guides

**Facebook Page Limitations:**
- Basic contact information only
- Limited photo organisation options
- No custom forms or enquiry systems
- Poor mobile emergency contact access
- Minimal service description space
- No integration with trade tools

**Example: Emergency Plumber Comparison**

**Website Experience:**
- Large emergency contact number visible immediately
- One-tap calling from mobile devices
- Emergency service explanation and pricing
- Coverage area map with response times
- Customer testimonials for emergency work

**Facebook Page Experience:**
- Contact information buried in "About" section
- No emergency service prominence
- Limited space for service explanations
- Poor mobile emergency accessibility
- Mixed content makes finding information difficult

## Cost Analysis: Hidden Facebook Advertising Costs

While Facebook pages are "free," reaching customers effectively requires significant advertising investment:

**Facebook Advertising Reality:**
- Organic reach averages 2-6% of followers
- Effective reach requires £200-£500+ monthly advertising
- Competitor ads appear on your page
- No guarantee of sustained visibility
- Costs increase as competition grows

**Website Cost Comparison:**
- Our [free trade website setup](/free-trade-websites-uk) with £10/month hosting
- No ongoing advertising required for basic visibility
- Search engine traffic grows organically over time
- One-time investment in professional presence
- No competitor interference

**5-Year Cost Projection:**
- Facebook advertising: £12,000-£30,000+
- Professional website: £600 total (5 years × £10/month × 12 months)

## Customer Journey and Experience

Professional websites provide superior customer experiences throughout the decision-making process:

**Website Customer Journey:**
1. Find business through Google search
2. Browse comprehensive service information
3. View detailed project galleries
4. Read customer testimonials with specifics
5. Contact through professional enquiry system
6. Receive prompt, professional response

**Facebook Page Customer Journey:**
1. Find business through social media or advertising
2. Scroll through mixed personal and business content
3. Struggle to find comprehensive service information
4. See limited, poorly organised project photos
5. Contact through basic messaging system
6. Uncertain response time and professionalism

**Mobile Experience Comparison:**
Mobile users represent 70%+ of trade searches, and websites significantly outperform Facebook pages on mobile devices:

- Faster loading times for service information
- Better emergency contact accessibility
- Professional appearance on all devices
- Optimised enquiry forms and contact methods

## Social Proof and Community Building

Facebook does excel in areas where websites are weaker:

**Facebook Strengths:**
- Real-time customer interaction and engagement
- Community building and local networking
- Social proof through likes, shares, and comments
- Behind-the-scenes content and personality display
- Local community group participation

**Website Limitations:**
- Static testimonials vs dynamic social interaction
- No real-time engagement with customers
- Limited community building capabilities
- Less personality and behind-the-scenes insight

## The Winning Strategy: Integrated Approach

The most successful UK tradespeople use both platforms strategically:

**Website as Primary Hub:**
- Professional credibility and trust building
- Comprehensive service and portfolio information
- Search engine optimisation and organic traffic
- Lead generation and conversion focus
- Professional contact and enquiry management

**Facebook as Support Platform:**
- Social proof and community engagement
- Behind-the-scenes content and personality
- Customer interaction and relationship building

**Integration Strategy:**

- Use Facebook for quick updates and engagement
- Share website content through Facebook posts
- Collect email addresses through website for direct marketing
- Use both platforms to reinforce brand messaging

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

## FAQs

**Can I start with just Facebook and add a website later?**
Yes, but starting with a website builds credibility faster and captures more opportunities from day one. Transitioning later means rebuilding trust and search presence.

**How much time does each platform require?**
Websites require minimal ongoing time after setup. Facebook needs daily interaction and content creation to maintain engagement and visibility.

**What if my customers are mostly on Facebook?**
Even if customers discover you on Facebook, they often research businesses through Google before hiring. Having both ensures you don't lose opportunities.

**Do I need to advertise on Facebook to be effective?**
With organic reach below 6%, Facebook advertising is essentially required for meaningful visibility. Websites generate organic traffic without ongoing advertising costs.

**Which should I prioritise with limited time and budget?**
Start with a professional website for credibility and search visibility, then add Facebook for community engagement when time and resources allow.
