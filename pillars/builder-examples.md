## What Makes Builder Websites Win Work

Successful builder websites understand customer psychology. Property owners making construction decisions feel anxious about costs, timelines, and quality. Your website must address these concerns while demonstrating competence and reliability.

**High-Converting Builder Website Elements:**
- **Project Galleries**: Before/after photos of similar properties in your area
- **Speciality Clarity**: Clear positioning as extension specialists, renovation experts, or new build contractors  
- **Local Credibility**: Testimonials from recognisable local areas with specific project details
- **Transparent Processes**: Step-by-step explanations of how projects work
- **Professional Signals**: Insurance details, trade association memberships, planning permission expertise

**Common Mistakes That Lose Work:**
- Generic stock photos instead of actual project images
- Vague service descriptions that could apply to any builder
- Missing planning permission and building regulation information
- No local testimonials or area-specific examples
- Poor mobile experience for busy property owners
